# JS UNIT TESTS

Implementation of functions to meet proposed requirements and/or unit tests to ensure that the implementations of functions are correct.

**Objective**: put into practice the following abilities:
* Write `unit tests` to functions using the `Jest` module from `NodeJS` in order to check the correct operation of functions;
* Write functions from tests already implemented, so they meet the proposed tests;
* Write tests and functions applying TDD - Test Driven Development.

* **:hammer_and_wrench: Used tools:**
  * Jest
  * NodeJS
  * VS Code

In every [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) project are employed `linters`, `Cypress` `Git` and `GitHub`.

Project build-up in the Web Development Fundamentals Module of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course.
